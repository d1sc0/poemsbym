As I walked into the Concert Hall just an hour before the performance was due to begin, there was a great sense of anticipation.  
The silence was almost haunting and even the clock on the wall was not making a sound.  
It seemed as if the whole world stood still waiting for some sort of eruption.  
Everything lay in place, the instruments were ready, the music stands all set for the players and in the centre a grand piano standing in its grandeur ready for the maestro to create a sound which would send the audience into another captivating world.  
Soon the instruments on the stage lying idle would be transformed into a symphony of sound and the whole house would vibrate with joyful expectation.
