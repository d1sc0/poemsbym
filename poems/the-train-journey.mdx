I get so excited when boarding a train as it helps me relax more than bus, car or plane.  
I imagine my artist pad poised ready to go to capture the landscape from the window on show.  
The fields are a carpet of deep mossy green and the flowers could make a posy fit for any queen.  
The trees by the wind are being swayed, but tomorrow could stand tall like soldiers on parade.  
My imaginary sketch pad takes me past churches and spires and country lanes and houses with their open log fires.  
On to coves and beaches where children have fun and pensioners sit in deckchairs and go to sleep in the sun.  
As the train pulls into the station I become rather sad as the painting in the window dies away but let's hope it won't be too long before a train ride another day.
