My mum, she was so talented  
My mum, she was all heart  
My mum, her gifts were numerous I just don't know where to start.  
A dress for every occasion was made with love and tears and her expertise on the piano brought music to your ears.  
She baked a cake or made a meal for friends and neighbours quite a few
And gave apples from the orchard to make a pie or two.  
She also loved to sing and her voice gave others pleasure and my thoughts of her just overflow because I loved her beyond measure.
