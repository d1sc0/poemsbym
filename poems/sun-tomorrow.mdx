When passing the charity shop one day I spied a chair, old, very tatty and somewhat grey.
How long had this been in the window, a month, a year, or just today.
I pondered on the history of such a p piece and thought in its day it truly had been a masterpiece.
Who could have sat in this chair to rest their tired and weary bones, a man returning from a trip at sea or a mother nursing a small child, or an old man living all alone.
I was so tempted to go and buy the chair but I thought that today I ought to leave it there.
Who knows, there maybe someone who needs a chair like that, a frail old lady or just a tired cat.
